ytitle: Hemagglutinin, the Influenza Virus Protein
description: "Hemagglutinin is a protein found on the surface of the influenza virus."
excerpt: "Hemagglutinin is a protein found on the surface of the influenza virus. It is responsible for binding the virus to the host cell, initiating the infection process. Hemagglutinin is a target for the immune system, and antibodies against it can prevent infection."

Most hemagglutinins have been found to target sialic acids, a family of nine-carbon sugar molecules that are commonly found at the tips of glycans, or sugar chains, that are attached to proteins and lipids on the cell surface. Sialic acid can be linked to glycans in different ways.|

## Hemagglutinin Cleavage

|![](https://imgur.com/JHTlQyR.png)<br>© Dr.G Bhanu[^Dr_G_Bhanu]|Hemagglutinin (HA) has lots of conformations. The HA0 is the original form of the protein on the virus surface. It then cleaved into HA1 and HA2 by host proteases in the endosomes. Proteases only cleave inner cell HA0[^zhirnov2002cleavage]. After the cleavage, the fusion peptid is exposed which is in the end of the HA2|

At low pH in endosomes, about pH 5.5, depending on the virus strain, fusion of virus and endosomal membranes is activated in a process that involves extensive changes in HA conformation[^PA.Bullough_94]

## Anchor of the HA Protein

Donald J. Benton, et al., observe the structure of the region that anchors HA in the virus membrane as **a bundle of three α-helices** that are joined to the ectodomain by flexible linkages. And the **fab**, HA−FISW84, binds to near there ([6HJQ](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6HJQ)) my affects the **flexibility** of the linker and prevents the conformational changes that are necessary for membrane **fusion**[^Benton_18].
